		With the rise of online banking, cryptocurrencies and other digital transformation, it has become mandatory to backup sensitive files. Those file need to be easily accessible, securely stored and encrypted. But lightweight, standalone, cross platform vault software are surprisingly hard to come by. Password protected archive works fine but they let room for file leakage as there is no convenient way of exploring the vault unless extracting the whole content. Jsafebox was made to cover these shortfalls.
